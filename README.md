# Simulation of an insurance claim center
## Abstract
This project involves a one-month simulation of an insurance claim center. The center processes complainants and guilty parties through various stages, including photography, documentation, claim investigation, complaint filing, and file completion. The project is divided into three phases: problem modeling, simulation using Python, and performance analysis.

## Problem Description
The project focuses on modeling an auto insurance claim center that operates from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Customers may arrive separately, but they must be together for the entire process. The simulation covers various aspects, including wait times and system performance.

## Key Results
* The center operates beyond its scheduled hours, with an average closing time of 2:58 AM.
* Customers spend an average of over 5 hours in the system.
* The investigation unit experiences high employee utilization and long customer wait times.
* Sensitivity analysis provides insights into system performance under different parameter changes.

## Results of Sensitivity Analysis
The sensitivity analysis explores the impact of changes in parameters such as staffing, photography duration, investigation time, and complaint probability on system performance.

## Alternative Systems Proposed
Two alternative systems are proposed and compared to the original system. These alternatives modify arrival patterns, staffing, service times, and complaint handling.

## Proposed Improvement Policies
The project suggests improvement policies based on sensitivity analysis. These policies aim to address system bottlenecks, reduce waiting times, and enhance overall system performance.
